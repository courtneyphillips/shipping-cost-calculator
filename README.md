## Synopsis

Shipping Cost Calculator built by [Courtney Phillips](https://github.com/courtneymaepdx) and [Garrett Olson](https://github.com/garedean) as part of the Spring 2015 Ruby course curriculum at [Epicodus](https://www.epicodus.com/). It tracks and calculates the shipping costs for packages of varying size/weight for a fictional shipping company.

## Motivation

## Installation

Shipping Cost Calculator uses the following gems:

  - Capybara
  - Sinatra
  - RSpec
  - Pry

To install, run `$ gem install bundle` in the command line.
